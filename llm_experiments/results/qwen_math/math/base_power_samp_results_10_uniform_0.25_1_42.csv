Then, we will find the value of \(a + b + m\).

### Step 1: Find the \(x\)-intercept \(a\)
The \(x\)-intercept occurs where \(y = 0\). Substitute \(y = 0\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{0}{12} = 1
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 1
\]
Solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 4
\]
Thus, the \(x\)-intercept \(a\) is:
\[
a = 4
\]

### Step 2: Find the \(y\)-intercept \(b\)
The \(y\)-intercept occurs where \(x = 0\). Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{0}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
\frac{y}{12} = 1
\]
Solve for \(y\):
\[
y = 12
\]
Thus, the \(y\)-intercept \(b\) is:
\[
b = 12
\]

### Step 3: Find the slope \(m\)
To find the slope, we need to rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\). Start with the given equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1
\]
Multiply every term by 12 to clear the denominators:
\[
3x + y = 12
\]
Rearrange the equation to solve for \(y\):
\[
y = -3x + 12
\]
From this form, we can see that the slope \(m\) is:
\[
m = -3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \(a + b + m\)
Now, add the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\):
\[
a + b + m = 4 + 12 + (-3)
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
a + b + m = 13
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b + m\) is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]",13," To solve the problem, we need to determine the \(x\)-intercept \(a\), the \(y\)-intercept \(b\), and the slope \(m\) of the line given by the equation \(\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1\). Then, we will find the value of \(a + b + m\).

### Step 1: Find the \(x\)-intercept \(a\)
The \(x\)-intercept occurs when \(y = 0\). Substitute \(y = 0\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{0}{12} = 1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 1
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = 4
\]
Thus, the \(x\)-intercept \(a\) is:
\[
a = 4
\]

### Step 2: Find the \(y\)-intercept \(b\)
The \(y\)-intercept occurs when \(x = 0\). Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{0}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{y}{12} = 1
\]
Solving for \(y\):
\[
y = 12
\]
Thus, the \(y\)-intercept \(b\) is:
\[
b = 12
\]

### Step 3: Find the slope \(m\)
To find the slope, we need to rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\). Start with the given equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{12} = 1
\]
Multiply every term by 12 to clear the denominators:
\[
3x + y = 12
\]
Rearrange to solve for \(y\):
\[
y = -3x + 12
\]
From this form, we can see that the slope \(m\) is:
\[
m = -3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \(a + b + m\)
Now, we add the \(x\)-intercept \(a\), the \(y\)-intercept \(b\), and the slope \(m\):
\[
a + b + m = 4 + 12 + (-3)
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
a + b + m = 4 + 12 - 3 = 13
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b + m\) is:
\[
\boxed{13}

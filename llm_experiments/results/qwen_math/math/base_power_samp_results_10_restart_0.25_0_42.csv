"Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$","\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)"," To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). The formulas for converting from rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) are:

\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]

Given the point \((0, 3)\), we have \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(r\)
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\theta\)
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
\]

The expression \(\frac{3}{0}\) is undefined, which indicates that the angle \(\theta\) is at a vertical line. Since the point \((0, 3)\) is located on the positive \(y\)-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

### Step 3: Verify the quadrant
The point \((0, 3)\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\) is indeed within the range \(0 \le \theta < 2\pi\).

### Final Answer
Thus, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are:

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]","(3, \frac{\pi}{2})"," To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we need to use the following relationships:

1. The distance \( r \) from the origin to the point, which is calculated as:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   where \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 3 \).

2. The angle \( \theta \) formed with the positive x-axis, which is calculated as:
   \[
   \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]
   and adjusted for the correct quadrant. 

Let's calculate these step-by-step using Python.
```python
import math

# Given point in rectangular coordinates
x = 0
y = 3

# Calculate r
r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate θ
theta = math.atan2(y, x)

# Convert θ to the range [0, 2π)
if theta < 0:
    theta += 2 * math.pi

print(((r, theta)))
```
```output
(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)
```
The polar coordinates corresponding to the point \((0, 3)\) in rectangular coordinates are:

\[
\boxed{(3, 1.5707963267948966)}
\]

This converts to approximately \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\) in standard mathematical terms.

If Joe randomly selects letters to form four-letter words that begin and end with the same letter, what is the probability that a word formed this way will meet his criteria? To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly selected four-letter word will start and end with the same letter. We will assume that each letter is selected independently and that the letters can be repeated. We will also assume that the words are formed using the 26 letters of the English alphabet.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Total number of possible four-letter words**: Since each position in the four-letter word can be any of the 26 letters, the total number of possible four-letter words is \(26^4\).
  
2. **Number of favorable outcomes**: The word starts and ends with the same letter. The first and last letter can be any of the 26 letters, and the two middle letters can be any of the 26 letters. So, the number of favorable outcomes is \(26 \times 26 \times 26 = 26^3\).
  
3. **Probability calculation**: The probability that a randomly selected four-letter word will start and end with the same letter is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, which is \(\frac{26^3}{26^4} = \frac{1}{26}\).

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{1}{26}\).

Let's implement this reasoning in Python using sympy to ensure the result is accurate.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the total number of possible four-letter words
total_words = 26**4

# Define the number of favorable outcomes
favorable_words = 26**3

# Calculate the probability
probability = favorable_words / total_words

print(probability)
```
```output
0.038461538461538464
```
The output \(0.038461538461538464\) is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{26}\). Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected four-letter word will start and end with the same letter is \(\frac{1}{26}\).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{26}}\).",\frac{1}{26},"Can you solve the following math problem? Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we need to use the following formulas:

1. The distance \(r\) from the origin to the point, which is calculated as:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   where \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\).

2. The angle \(\theta\) formed with the positive x-axis, which is calculated as:
   \[
   \theta = \begin{cases} 
   \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) & \text{if } x > 0 \\
   \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) + \pi & \text{if } x < 0 \text{ and } y \ge 0 \\
   \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) - \pi & \text{if } x < 0 \text{ and } y < 0 \\
   \frac{\pi}{2} & \text{if } x = 0 \text{ and } y > 0 \\
   \frac{3\pi}{2} & \text{if } x = 0 \text{ and } y < 0
   \end{cases}
   \]
   Since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), we fall into the case where \(x = 0\) and \(y > 0\), so \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
import math

# Given rectangular coordinates
x = 0
y = 3

# Calculate r
r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate theta
# Since x = 0 and y > 0, theta is pi/2
theta = math.pi / 2

print(((r, theta)))
```
```output
(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)
```
The polar coordinates for the point \((0, 3)\) are \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\).

So the final answer is:
